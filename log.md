# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setting up this GitHub log.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start back coding after three years of on and off coding. I think to begin I will pick back up where I left off a few months ago on the Codecademy programming course list.

### Day 1: November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started back on Codecademy programming course list. Completed another 5% of the Python 2 course, looking to complete it by this weekend.
I also started JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp, only completed 10 lessons as I am short on time today. Hoping to make more of a dent and begin the codecademy and SoloLearn courses over JavaScript once I am through my first pass of Python 2.

**Thoughts:** I will for sure need to go back through the Python 2 course to get a refresher and to really work on some areas I struggled on. Just want to finish one run through before I reset my course status, thinking this will be better for me to really hammer in the concepts of the entire course.
