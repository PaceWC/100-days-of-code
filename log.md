# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setting up this GitHub log.

**Thoughts:** Excited to start back coding after three years of on and off coding. I think to begin I will pick back up where I left off a few months ago on the Codecademy programming course list.
