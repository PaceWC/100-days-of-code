# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Since I am starting all over I cleared out all of my progress on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. I Have decided to work towards finishing the Responsive Web Design Certification. This can take an estimated 300 hours of work/study time to complete. We'll see if I can wrap it up in under 100days! Today I completed 28/28 of the Baisc HTML and HTML5 challenges, and 22/44 of the Basic CSS challenges. This leaves <s>139</s> 144 challenges left before I will begin the Responsive Web Design Projects. Which must be finished to obtain the certification.
Overall today I did not really learn anything new, but rather reveiwed the basics of HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this journey again! This time I fully plan to see it through the 100 day mark and beyond. Come <a href="https://days.to/5-february/2020">February 5, 2020</a> I may not be where I wish in my coding skills, but I will be one giant step closer to that goal.

### Day 2: October 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Day 2 in the books!! First day back at work after a 5 day vacation so I was pushing it on being able to get a solid hour in of coding today, but I managed. I wrapped up the remaining challenges of Basic CSS and finished Applied Visual Design. Bringing me to a total of 124 challenges completed out of the 194. Only 70 challenges remaining and then the real fun begins!

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, glad to be back doing some coding. Even if it's something as minor as this. Thinking up a few side projects to work on while working to finish this up as well as the design projects for the certs.
