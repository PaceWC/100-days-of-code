# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Since I am starting all over I cleared out all of my progress on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. I Have decided to work towards finishing the Responsive Web Design Certification. This can take an estimated 300 hours of work/study time to complete. We'll see if I can wrap it up in under 100days! Today I completed 28/28 of the Baisc HTML and HTML5 challenges, and 22/44 of the Basic CSS challenges. This leaves 139 challenges left before I will begin the Responsive Web Design Projects. Which must be finished to obtain the certification.
Overall today I did not really learn anything new, but rather reveiwed the basics of HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this journey again! This time I fully plan to see it through the 100 day mark and beyond. Come February 5, 2020 I may not be where I wish in my coding skills, but I will be one giant step closer to that goal.
